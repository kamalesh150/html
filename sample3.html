<h1><strong>TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR</strong></h1>
<hr />
<p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br />
How I wonder what you are!<br />
Up above the world so high,<br />
Like a diamond in the sky.<br /></p>
<p>

<p>When the blazing sun is gone,<br />
When he nothing shines upon,<br />
Then you show your little light,<br />
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br /></p>

<p>Then the traveler in the dark<br />
Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br />
How could he see where to go,<br />
If you did not twinkle so?<br /></p>

<p>In the dark blue sky you keep,<br />
Often through my curtains peep<br />
For you never shut your eye,<br />
Till the sun is in the sky.<br /></p>

<p>As your bright and tiny spark<br />
Lights the traveler in the dark,<br />
Though I know not what you are,<br />
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.<br /></p>
